Autoclicker made for a friend to perform repeated actions in games while they are AFK.
The app is set to OFF on startup.

1) Export to .jar and execute.
2) While on the autoclicker window, press SHIFT + ALT + 8 to toggle the autoclicker.
   * You have a 10 second window frame to tab into your selected program.  This time window can be edited by changing the waitTimeLimit variable (in seconds). 
3) Aim or hover on what you want autoclicked.
